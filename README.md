Programming like it's 1989!
===========================

It a fit of nostalgia triggered by the awesome [MEGA=64][1] project, I decided
I want to re-visit my childhood in a new way: I'll explore the C64 in more
detail than ever by learning MOS6502/6510 assembly language.

This is a pure fun project, I have no specific goal in mind and it will only
make any progress if I can find the time.
